Java programming I have done

04/30/2017

I've finally uploaded the actual JavaFX version of the code (ChoiceTest_JAVAFX.java) that I created a few months ago (see "I decided to write a program recently to use JavaFX..." below), along with a picture of the original program and the JavaFX version running.

I should also note that the code for the original version (ChoiceFrame.java and ChoiceTest.java) were the solutions that were handed out in class after the original assignment was complete to compare any changes between the code my classmates and I submitted versus the solution version. So technically, it is not actually the work that *I* did from the class, making the part "... I have some work that is from... class..." somewhat invalid.

However, aside from making methods similar to ChoiceTest.java to create the buttons, and other options separately from each other, the rest of the code is mine.

These are Java programs. I took a Java course when I was a student at UCLA (PIC 20A). So, I have some work that is from or based on the class.

For example, I have a program that involves changing a piece of text's font, size and whether it appears in bold or italics. This was part of one of the homework assignments I needed to do, which was using Swing. I decided to write a program recently to use JavaFX to do the same.

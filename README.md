Java programming I have done

10/31/2016

These are Java work. I took a Java course when I was a student at UCLA - PIC 20A. So, I have some work that is from or based on the class.

For example, I have a program that involves changing a piece of text's font, size and whether it appears in bold or italics. This was part of one of the homework assignments I needed to do, which was using Swing. I decided to write a program recently to use JavaFX to do the same.
